Customer Segmentation is a marketing and analytics strategy used to group customers based on shared characteristics.
It allows businesses to better understand the needs, preferences, and behaviors of their customer base.
Segmentation can be based on demographics, psychographics, geography, or behavioral patterns.
By identifying these groups, companies can create targeted marketing campaigns.
It helps in optimizing resources and improving return on investment (ROI).
Personalized offers can be designed to match specific customer needs.
It also improves customer satisfaction and loyalty.
In our project, we used unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers.
Clustering methods such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering were applied.
These insights can guide product recommendations, promotions, and strategic decisions.""")
